Python Flask Blockchain Application
This project is a simple implementation of a blockchain application using Python and Flask. The application incorporates various cryptographic techniques, including asymmetric encryption, a digital signature mechanism using the RSA algorithm, and the implementation of a Merkle tree for enhanced data integrity.

Features
Asymmetric Encryption:

Implemented a custom asymmetric encryption algorithm without using pre-existing libraries.
Digital Signature Mechanism:

Developed a digital signature mechanism using the RSA algorithm.
Ensures the authenticity and integrity of transactions in the blockchain.
Blockchain Core Features:

User Interface:

Created a web-based user interface using Flask for easy interaction with the blockchain.
Encryption and Digital Signature Integration:

Integrated the methods from asymmetric encryption and digital signature tasks for secure transactions.
Hashing:

Implemented hashing using existing libraries for enhanced security.
Blocks and Transaction Management:

Added functionality for adding blocks and managing transactions.
Merkle Tree Implementation:

Integrated a Merkle tree to enhance data integrity within the blockchain.
